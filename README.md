# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.5, Visual Studio Code, 1.68.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview
The weekly challenge assignment expanded upon the module to include addtional summary and analysis elements.

1. Get a complete list of counties that participated.
2. Calculate the total votes cast in each county.
3. Calculate the percentage of total votes cast from each county.
4. Determine the county with the largest voter turnout.

The challenge really helped solidify how to recall information stored in dictionaries and how to build the various for and while statements.

## Challenge Summary
The analysis of the challenge portion of the elction reported as:
- The counties involved in the election were:
    - Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe
- The results from each county were:
    - Citizens in Jefferson County cast 10.5% of the total vote, with a tally of 38,855 votes.
    - Citizens in Denver County cast 82.8 of the total vote, with a tally of 306,055 votes.
    - Citizens in Arapahoe County cast 6.7% of the total vote, with a tally of 24,801 votes.
- Denver County, accordingly, had the greatest overall voter turnout based on this summary.

It would be interesting to also have had how many registered voters reside in each county, so that a furhter analysis of actual to potential voter turnout could have been assessed. While Denver County had the greatest overall turnout, it is certainly possible that Denver County also has the largest population of total residents, and potentially the largest population of residents eligible to vote.

## Challenges of the Challenge
I definitely <i>enjoy</i> Python development more than VBA development, but having learned VBA first, the expansion into Python programming was pretty seemless. There are a few formatting nuances that I experienced in trying to get my terminal output to matchup with my text file output, but learning the initial formatting syntax was exciting.

I can already see how I could potentially apply Python to my dat to day development needs, and I clearly see the advantages. Building upon last week's challenge, the ability in Python to declare lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and then manage those lists with (at least for dictionaries and lists) the ability to add and remove objects, is of incredible value. I'm looking forward to expanding on my Python abilities by translating some of my existing VBA projects into Python script to increase the efficiencies in my work!
